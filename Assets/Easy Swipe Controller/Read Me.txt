Thank you for buying my Swipe Controller Script.

Try out the 2 demo scenes in _Scenes folder.
When you want to use the script in your own project then just add the SwipeController to an GameObject and add directive using MOSoft.SwipeController;
You don't need to add it to the player!
After that you can check with the following methods what type of swipe direction is occurred
For example: 
SwipeController.getInstance.isUp() or SwipeController.getInstance.isTap() and so on...

If you have any questions or problems just contact me under the following
